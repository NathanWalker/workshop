## Nx Challenge Part 4 - BONUS TIME

Have you completed all requirements of the Nx challenges and still have time left? Good news! There’s still more fun to be had.

Take whatever time you have left and implement more foundational services for things your company or team may need.

If you’re having trouble coming up with good ideas, we have a few suggestions.

* Http interceptor improvements
    * Perhaps your project has specific http needs that could be done in 1 place, in the interceptor!
* A new theme
    * Try a different [color scheme](https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/theme#color-schemes) to give your app a whole new look.
* Random pet
    * Give the user a way of seeing for a random pet.
